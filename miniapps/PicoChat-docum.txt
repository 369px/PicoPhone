PICOCHAT implementation in PicoPhone

Inside a new created folder named 
"/miniapps/picochat/"

1. Added all picochat cart content


Inside picochat folder, mainChat.lua:

2. Deleted _init()

3. Added firstTime=true outside all functions

4. 	Added this in _update() 
	(to fake an _init() function without having it):
	
	if firsTime then send() firstTime=false end
 

5. Deleted window{} call cause we don't need it

6. Changed _draw() and _update() function names into
	drawChat() and updateChat()

7. Changed all include paths into new ones (just added
	miniapps/picochat/ before each include	path)

8. Changed all gui instances to chatGui

9. Commented cls()

10. changed msgbar.x from 0 to 7


inside utils/utilityFunctions.lua: 
(bad file name and position, I'll change them)

11. Added "elseif currentPage=="chat" then drawChat()"
	inside "drawOS()" which is called in _draw()


Inside main.lua:

12. Added if currentPage=="chat" then updateCalc() end
	inside _update() 


Inside inits.lua

13. inside bootPhone() added icon GUI:

		local chatApp = mainMenu:attach{ x = startMenuX+32+3, y = startMenuY+32+3,width=32,height=32,
							clicked=false,cursor="pointer",
							draw=function(self)
									if self.clicked==false then spr(14,0,0)
									else spr(21,0,0) end
							end,
							tap=function(self)
								lastPage=currentPage currentPage="chat"
							end,
							click=function(self) self.clicked=true end,
							release=function(self) self.clicked=false end
		}
	
	(i'll soon add miniapps in a table and draw them inside 
	a loop like I did with the market)

14. Still inside inits.lua added 
	include "/phone.p64.png/miniapps/picochat/mainChat.lua"
